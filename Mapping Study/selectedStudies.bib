  problem = {Because of the noncritical nature of the projects and the characteristics
	of SMEs (project pressure with few people to move around), we encountered
	problems with re- sources and management expectations within the
	companies. From this we learned that management must set aside and
	enforce time for the developers to work on the product line project,
	and they must show their support. Otherwise, working on the product
	line project becomes a spare-time activity, with normal project demands
	tak- ing over the domain expertsÕ time
	
	We found that the domain experts worked on the project only when we
	had meetings, and these were hard to schedule. Therefore, our initial
	plan of having meetings one day every other week was not producing
	results very quickly. Changing to larger blocks of meetings (for
	example, three days in a row) produced more results even if these
	meet- ings occurred less frequently.
	
	The companies had no systematic devel- opment processes in place;
	they mostly fo- cused on producing products (code). There- fore,
	we had to introduce both systematic development and product line
	engineering at once. This a large change in work habits, so we had
	to minimize the impacts felt by this change and provide a lot of
	guidance on this new way of working.
	
	But meeting size was an issue: having discussions with more than five
	ex- perts could be a problem. The meetings also needed to be focused,
	with concrete goals (in terms of what domain topics would be covered).
	Otherwise, there was very little preparation and the discussion might
	span a variety of topics. Different interest groups (management vs.
	developers, or academics vs. industry participants) would try to
	push the topics covering their interests. Of course, focused meetings
	alone cannot solve this problem. We sometimes found it beneficial
	to act as impartial moderators to facilitate the alignment of these
	interest groups.
	
	Our training approachÑa one-day train- ing session and then training
	while doing (along with examples of how to do it)Ñen- abled the domain
	experts to simultaneously learn the approach and produce results.
	In general, the companies liked to talk about their domain, but they
	all had trouble writ- ing down results at the required abstraction
	level. Providing examples in their own do- main helped them learn
	how to abstract and document. The experts all felt that the dif-
	ferent viewpoint offered by the external do- main analystÑwhich was
	our role in the projectÑimproved their understanding of their systems
	and domain. However, there are so
	
	First, we were responsible for documenting the models so that we could
	produce good examples based on discussions with experts. This was
	a problem because we had to learn a lot, as we are not domain experts.
	
	Also, we could not model anything that was not discussed in meetings.
	Therefore, it is im- portant to transfer modeling responsibility
	to the domain experts as soon as possible.
	
	The company should take responsibility for the sample documents as
	soon as possible so that it owns them, gets used to maintaining them,
	and finally uses them.
	
	Tool supoert is necessary to some degree. First, the companies really
	wanted tools. Second, because of the amount of informa- tion and
	the many relationships and de- pendencies, tool support helps with
	intellec- tual control of the information. When the method must be
	customized as you go, you need tool support that can adapt to this.
	
	the size of SMEs, usually only a few architects are available to de-
	velop the reference architecture. In the companies in the Software
	Variant-Building Project (the same six we chose to work with Pulse),
	these architects are also responsible for the architecture of the
	existing systems. Of course, they tend to resist changes to their
	architectures for two reasons: first, they simply want to avoid as
	much rework as possible, and second, they hesitate to ad- mit that
	there could be better solutions than the ones they developed on their
	own. We found it hard to overcome these prob- lems; the only way
	to achieve cooperation is to motivate them to come up with their
	own suggestions for the architecture and to just guide the process.},

	a complete domain. Also, the process must be optimally suited to

  abstract = {The tremendous benefits of taking a software product line approach
	are well documented. Organizations have achieved significant reductions
	in cost and time to market and, at the same time, increased the quality
	of families of their software systems. However, to date, there are
	considerable barriers to organizational adoption of product line
	practices and to widespread product line practice. Phased adoption
	is attractive as a risk reduction and fiscally viable proposition.
	This report introduces a variant of the Factory pattern called the
	Adoption Factory pattern that provides a generic roadmap to guide
	a manageable, phased product line adoption strategy. In addition,
	the report examines the Adoption Factory pattern from multiple useful
	views and describes how it can be used. The report concludes with
	a summary of the Carnegie MellonÂ® Software Engineering Instituteâ€™s
	experiences with the pattern to date and its future plans with regard

	strongly emphasize the role of technology transfer, as many facets

  abstract = {Software Product Lines is the culmination of an intensive investigation,
	undertaken by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie
	Mellon, into how leading-edge software development organizations
	have "retooled" for product lines. With explanations of fundamental
	concepts further illuminated by real-world experience, this book
	spells out the technical issues involved in adopting a product line
	strategy, as well as the organizational and management issues that
	are so critical for success. In providing a comprehensive set of
	practices and patterns, this book defines and explores the key activities
	for software product line development and explains specific practice
	areas in engineering, technical management, and organizational management.
	Highlights include: The benefits of a software product line approach,
	including actual improvement data from industrial success stories.
	Methods to develop a reusable base of core assets and to develop
	products that utilize that core. Common problems paired with concrete
	solutions in the form of reusable software product pine patterns.
	Twenty-nine practice areas for successful implementation, including
	architecture definition, component development, configuration management,
	market analysis, and training. The product line technical probe for
	identifying technical and organizational weaknesses that could impede
	success. Three detailed case studies from the industry lead you step
	by step through the process of developing and managing software product
	lines, illustrating potential pitfalls, creative solutions, and the
	ultimate rewards. Discussion questions, sidebars, and real-world
	anecdotes from the trenches reveal the collective wisdom of those
	on the front line of software product line ventures.},
